# Computational framework to study the role of chromosomal instability in aneuploid childhood B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 

This repository contains the code files which have been partially used to generate de data shown on the manuscript "Ongoing chromosomal instability across aneuploid subtypes of childhood B-Cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia associates with disease progression". 

- `parameters.m`: script containing the information about all relevant parameters, including growth rate, death rate, probability of missegregation per mitotic event, probability of undergoing whole genome duplication and more. 
- `binormal.m`: normal approximation to binomial distribution.
- `exportingData.m` and `plots_fitnessPerChromosome.m` are auxiliar files to export data and generate some exploratory plots.
- 'Main_fitnessPerChromosome.m` is the core file to conduct the simulations.
